# 👋 Hi, I'm Beiran (Flcookie)

💡 Exploring how **AI engineering** and **LangChain ecosystems** can empower real-world problem solving.  
🌱 I treat this GitHub as my **learning garden** — every repo here documents a step of progress.  
📚 Currently diving deep into **LangGraph**, **RAG pipelines**, and **multi-agent workflows**.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- 🧩 Building open-source copilots with **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Streamlit**  
- 🧠 Studying **agentic AI frameworks** and practical **retrieval-augmented generation**  
- 🏭 Exploring how **AI + Supply Chain Analytics** can shape enterprise systems
